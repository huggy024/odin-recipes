            <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>200g/7oz smoked tofu</li>
            <li>100g/3½oz rye breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>small bunch fresh flatleaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zest only</li>
            <li>50g/1¾oz Parmesan (or a similar vegetarian alternative), grated</li>
            <li>50g/1¾oz sesame seeds, toasted</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To serve</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 burger buns or slices rye bread</li>
            <li>6 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 pinches smoked paprika</li>
            <li>12 small lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>2 avocados, sliced</li>
            <li>punnet salad cress, picked</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
            <li>Put the carrots in a roasting tin and coat in the spices and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and cover with foil. Roast for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and roast for another 10 minutes, until soft and starting to brown.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, crumble half the tofu into a bowl and stir in the breadcrumbs, parsley, lemon zest, Parmesan and sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Blend the carrots with the remaining tofu in a food processor, until well combined and pretty smooth. Leave to cool.</li>
            <li>Mash the carrot and breadcrumb mixtures until they come together. If your mixture looks a little dry, add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil or water.</li>
            <li>Shape the mixture into six patties and put them into the fridge for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and cook the burgers for 3–4 minutes on each side, flipping them once they are well coloured.</li>
            <li>To serve, toast the burger buns. Spread each bun with a tablespoon of mayonnaise, add a pinch of paprika, then top with the lettuce leaves, avocado, burger and a handful of cress.</li>
        </ol>
